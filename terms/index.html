Client warrants and represents that all material it provides to Millicast and all use of Service will accord with such rules, and agrees to indemnify, defend and hold harmless Millicast from any action or claim(s) resulting from or associated with Client’s use of the Service, which damages Millicast, Client or any other party(ies) in any way. Client further agrees to remove Client content if properly notified that it infringes on another’s intellectual property rights pursuant to these Terms of Use.  Millicast reserves the right to remove content without prior notice.  Millicast also reserves the right to decide whether content is appropriate and complies with these Terms of Service for violations other than copyright infringement and violations of intellectual property law.  Millicast may remove such content and/or terminate a Client’s or user’s access for uploading such material in violation of these Terms of Service at any time, without prior notice and at Millicast’s sole discretion.

    <p>10. Service Level Guarantee and Credits: Millicast Services will be available at least 99.95% of the time as measured on a monthly basis for all paid accounts.

This does not include Force majeure, interruptions due to planned Millicast maintenance, improperly developed applications, claims without valid reproduction cases or with incomplete descriptions. Unavailable time starts when Client informs Millicast of the Service interruption via email to support@Millicast.com. Unavailable time ends when Service is restored to Client’s application. Service credits are calculated as a percentage of the total charges paid by Client each month. To receive a credit, Client must contact Millicast within two (2) business days following the end of the unavailability via email at support@Millicast.com and include the dates and times of unavailability. If the percentage of uptime applicable to the month of such a request is confirmed to be below 99.95%, Millicast will issue Client a service credit of 3% of Client’s monthly plan amount for every additional 30 minutes of unavailability below the 99.95% guarantee (up to 100% of customer’s monthly fee). This Service Level Guarantee is the sole and exclusive remedy for Millicast unavailability. Client hereby acknowledges and agrees that Millicast will not be liable for any temporary delay, outages or interruptions of the Services.

Except as provided in the Federal Arbitration Act, the arbitration award will be final and binding on the parties. Judgment may be entered in any court of competent jurisdiction.</p>
    <p>22. Export Regulations: The transfer of technology across national boundaries is regulated by the US Government. Client agrees not to export or re-export (including by way of electronic transmission) any data or technology derived from its audio and/or video stream without first obtaining any required export license or governmental approval. Client shall not directly or indirectly export or re-export (including by transmission) any regulated technology to any country to which such activity is restricted by US regulation or statute, without the prior written consent, if required, of the Bureau of Export Administration of the US Department of Commerce. This provision and the assurances made herein shall survive termination of this Agreement.</p>
    <p>23. Notices: All notices given hereunder must be in writing and transmitted by E-mail, Fax, U.S. Mail, return receipt requested, or special courier service (Fed Ex, UPS, etc.). Notice information shall be sent to Millicast, 25350 Magic Mountain Parkway, Suite 300, Santa Clarita, CA 91355.</p>
    <p>24. Miscellaneous: This is the entire Agreement between the parties. This Service Agreement supersedes all previous representations, understandings or agreements and shall prevail notwithstanding any variance with terms and conditions of any order submitted. This Agreement may be modified or amended only by a writing signed by the party against whom enforcement is sought. Any provision hereof found by a tribunal of competent jurisdiction to be illegal or unenforceable shall be automatically conformed to the minimum requirements of law and all other provisions shall remain in full force and effect. Headings are for reference purposes only and have no substantive effect. Each party is an independent contractor in relation to the other party with respect to all matters arising under this Agreement. Millicast failure to enforce at any time any provision of this Agreement does not waive Millicast’s rights to do so later. Use of Millicast’s Services constitutes acceptance of this Agreement. All other terms shall be negotiated in good faith.</p>
