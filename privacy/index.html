      <br />
      This Privacy Policy applies to Millicast’s Services that link to, or reference, this Privacy Policy, and describes the ways Millicast collects and uses your personal information and the choices you have regarding collection, use, maintenance, access and transmission of your personal information. Capitalized terms not expressly defined in this Privacy Policy shall have the meaning found in the Terms of Service. By utilizing the Millicast Service, including, without limitation, the website or otherwise providing your Personal Data to Millicast via any other means, you or the entity you represent ("you" or "your") accept and consent to the rights, obligations and practices described in this Privacy Policy.</p>

    <p>In the case of End Users, (a person who uses a Client’s application or website that incorporates the Millicast Service) Millicast has no direct relationship with such End User and Millicast will not collect their Personal Data directly from them. In the event an End User seeks to access, correct, amend or delete data, the End User should contact the Client directly.</p>
      <p>If you are a person who has directly signed up with Millicast for the use of Millicast’ Services and you seek to access, correct, amend, or delete data, you should contact Millicast directly. If requested to remove data under either scenario, Millicast will respond within a reasonable timeframe.</p>

    <h4>2. What Personal Data is Collected by Millicast?</h4>
